Description:

This repository provides a MATLAB script for analyzing beam deflection using the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. The script is a comprehensive tool for engineering students and professionals to understand and compute the deflection, shear force, and bending moment in beams subjected to various load conditions. The code is well-commented, making it easy to follow and adapt for specific beam analysis tasks.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

Initial Setup:

Data Definition: The script starts by defining the beam's physical properties and load conditions, including length (L), modulus of elasticity (E), moment of inertia (I), uniformly distributed load (w), point load (P), and maximum intensity of a triangular load (w_max).
Reaction Forces Calculation:

Support Reactions: It calculates the reaction forces at the beam's supports (R1, R2), considering the symmetry of the loading.
Shear Force and Bending Moment Analysis:

Symbolic Variables: Defines symbolic variables x, C1, and C2 for integration and differentiation.
Shear Force (V): Computes the shear force as a function of x, incorporating various loads (uniform, point, and triangular).
Bending Moment (M): Calculates the bending moment by integrating the shear force over x.
Deflection Analysis:

Euler-Bernoulli Equation: Applies the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation to find the beam's deflection. This involves differentiating the bending moment and integrating twice.
Boundary Conditions: Solves for the integration constants C1 and C2 using the boundary conditions (deflection is zero at both ends of the beam).
Numerical Evaluation and Maximum Deflection:

Function Handle: Creates a MATLAB function handle for deflection (y_func) to facilitate numerical evaluation.
Specific Deflections: Calculates deflections at the midpoint, 2 meters from the left support, and at the right support.
Maximum Deflection: Determines the point of maximum deflection on the beam and its value.
Results Display:

Printing Outputs: Displays the calculated reaction forces, deflections at specific points, and maximum deflection.
Graphical Representation:

Plotting: Generates plots for the shear force diagram, bending moment diagram, and deflection curve.
Visualizing Beam and Loads: Draw a schematic of the beam with supports and applied loads, enhancing the understanding of the load distribution and its impact.
