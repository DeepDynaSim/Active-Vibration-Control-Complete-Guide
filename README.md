Description:

This repository provides a MATLAB script for analyzing beam deflection using the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. The script is a comprehensive tool for engineering students and professionals to understand and compute the deflection, shear force, and bending moment in beams subjected to various load conditions. The code is well-commented, making it easy to follow and adapt for specific beam analysis tasks.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

Initial Setup:

Data Definition: The script starts by defining the beam's physical properties and load conditions, including length (L), modulus of elasticity (E), moment of inertia (I), uniformly distributed load (w), point load (P), and maximum intensity of a triangular load (w_max).
Reaction Forces Calculation:

Support Reactions: It calculates the reaction forces at the beam's supports (R1, R2), considering the symmetry of the loading.
Shear Force and Bending Moment Analysis:

Symbolic Variables: Defines symbolic variables x, C1, and C2 for integration and differentiation.
Shear Force (V): Computes the shear force as a function of x, incorporating various loads (uniform, point, and triangular).
Bending Moment (M): Calculates the bending moment by integrating the shear force over x.
Deflection Analysis:

Euler-Bernoulli Equation: Applies the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation to find the beam's deflection. This involves differentiating the bending moment and integrating twice.
Boundary Conditions: Solves for the integration constants C1 and C2 using the boundary conditions (deflection is zero at both ends of the beam).
Numerical Evaluation and Maximum Deflection:

Function Handle: Creates a MATLAB function handle for deflection (y_func) to facilitate numerical evaluation.
Specific Deflections: Calculates deflections at the midpoint, 2 meters from the left support, and at the right support.
Maximum Deflection: Determines the point of maximum deflection on the beam and its value.
Results Display:

Printing Outputs: Displays the calculated reaction forces, deflections at specific points, and maximum deflection.
Graphical Representation:

Plotting: Generates plots for the shear force diagram, bending moment diagram, and deflection curve.
Visualizing Beam and Loads: Draw a schematic of the beam with supports and applied loads, enhancing the understanding of the load distribution and its impact.

Overview:
Function Purpose: To calculate and potentially visualize the deflection of a cantilever beam under various conditions.
Inputs: Load force, Young's modulus, beam length, beam width, and cross-section type.
Outputs: End-tip deflection, end-tip slope angle, and a vector of deflection distances along the beam.
Function Breakdown:
Input Validation and Defaults:

Checks if sufficient arguments are provided. If not, it throws an error.
Sets the default cross-section type to 'rectangle' if not specified.
Validates the input types and constraints using validate attributes and validate string.
Moment of Inertia Calculation (calcMomentOfInertia):

This function calculates the moment of inertia (Ixx) based on the beam's cross-sectional shape. It handles four shapes: rectangle, circle, triangle, and hexagon.
The moment of inertia is essential for determining the beam's resistance to bending.
Deformation Calculation (calcDeformation):

This function calculates the end-tip deflection, end-tip slope, and a vector of deflections along the beam length.
These calculations use standard formulas from beam theory, incorporating the moment of inertia, beam properties, and load force.
Result Visualization (plotBeamDeflection):

If no output arguments are specified, the function plots the beam deflection.
The plot includes a line representing the beam and its deflection curve, with labels and a title indicating the cross-section type.
Example Usage:
The commented-out line at the end shows an example call to the function with specific parameters (load force of 1500 N, Young's modulus of 210e9 N/m^2, beam length of 3 m, beam width of 0.15 m, and a circular cross-section).
This example would calculate and potentially plot the deflection of a circular cantilever beam under the specified conditions.
Educational and Practical Significance:
For Students: This function is an excellent tool for learning how different parameters affect beam deflection. It provides a hands-on approach to understanding cantilever beam mechanics.
For Experts: It serves as a quick and efficient way to estimate cantilever beam deflections for different cross-sections, which is useful in the preliminary design and analysis phases.
Extensibility:
The function is designed to be easily extendable. Additional cross-sectional shapes or more complex loading conditions can be incorporated with minimal modifications.
